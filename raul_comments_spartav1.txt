excel sheet inputs

---------------------------------------
 If the calculations (for N assets) are correct, then adjust the drop downs to fit the format provided in the excel sheet. This should also include the ability to do qtr and cal calculations 
 
Then we need to start filling in the menu of pre-selected seasonal prices to calculate. One question is are we going to populate the database with history and update daily , or are we going to have the code grab the components of pre-selected items and calculate everything on the fly ? there are pros and cons to discuss there. 
 
Once calculations, daily seasonal and daily histogram and drop downs are completed we can work on the pre-selected items - done

seasonality - done

------------------
september vs august --done

nymex & ice futures & ice swaps to futures dataset {symbols}
brugerman dataset 

swaps to futures *** gasoil futures ICE equivalent? --done?
-----------------------

dropdown logic

seasonality calculations - must be right - start and end month of graph dependent on selection  - sept to august

month selection - additional slider needed

front leg - back leg--done


when front expries , assume whole thing expires ; sept 25 - sept 26 ; --done

sept 26 - sept 27 --done

once sept 26 or july 26 expires, everything starts dropdown --done

1st commodity must always expire first ; --done

=@GvDescription("#ICEGCMMK25", C4, "daily", "2", "0", "", "", , "", , , , , , "HundredThousandths", , FALSE, ) --done

Before going to N assets
seasonality fix
qtr / cal calculations
adjust dropdown
then finally N assets
